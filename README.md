# macOS Packages

## Introduction

This a collection of scripts that generate macOS packages for software, primarily runtimes and compilers, for installation on macOS.

This project exists beause of a personal preference to avoid autoinstalled dependencies by other packaging schemes such as Homebrew and MacPorts.

The packagers are published as make files with a concerted attempt at maintaining a consistent set of targets.
